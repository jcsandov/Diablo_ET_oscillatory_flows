# Diablo_ET_oscillatory_flows

Diablo is an open-source CFD solver, originally developed by John Taylor and Tom Bewley and others at UCSD. It solves the incompressible, Boussinesq Navier-Stokes equations in several simple geometries (extract from https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/jrt51/ and https://github.com/johnryantaylor/DIABLO).

This is a version adapted by Jorge Sandoval and Dr Tom Eaves, which is set up to solve the unsteady flow in different oscillatory boundary layers. The code was adapted by Jorge Sandoval to incorporate an Edge-Tracking algorithm based on the Kinetic Energy associated to a perturbed velocity field from the laminar exact solution.
